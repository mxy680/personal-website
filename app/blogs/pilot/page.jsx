      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Greetings to everyone diving into this inaugural post! Embarking on this digital odyssey feels exhilarating. Over the past two years, I've delved deep into the realms of machine learning and deep learning. The captivating world of computer vision, in particular, has held my fascination like no other. It's been a thrilling journey, unraveling the intricate layers of algorithms and neural networks that enable machines to 'see' and 'understand'.

          ​​Embarking on my journey with coding began unexpectedly. My first foray into the world of programming languages started with C# when I stumbled upon Unity, the game development platform. The allure of crafting interactive worlds captivated me, and I quickly found myself deeply immersed. It wasn’t long before I transitioned to Python, propelled by challenging Leetcode problems, unexplainable errors, and complex tutorials. It was through these challenges that I recognized the vast potential of coding, leading me to unearth the 'black box' that is deep learning.

          Reflecting on my growth, one project stands out as an emblematic representation of my evolution in coding. The "File Automation for Cohen’s Fashion Optical" project was born from a simple yet seemingly impossible hypothetical idea. My mother, who runs the business, expressed how pivotal such a system would be for streamlining operations. Using my naive determination and limited knowledge in C# Windows Forms, I embarked on creating a prototype. It was far from perfect, riddled with bugs and operational hiccups. However, this project mirrored my coding journey—what began as tentative steps filled with errors gradually transformed into a well-refined process. Over the years, with relentless updates and problem-solving, I finally created a nearly flawless project.

          Also, I would like to mention that I am eternally grateful for the opportunities I've been afforded, especially my tenure as a data scientist at EPIC Brokers. The trust they placed in me to spearhead multiple projects, attend pivotal meetings, and experience the dynamics of a professional IT environment was invaluable. Their challenges continuously push my boundaries, and I deeply appreciate how they recognize and never undervalue my potential.

          Recently, to further refine my expertise, I embarked on an academic journey through Andrew Ng's Deep Learning AI courses. The intricate interplay of mathematics and machine learning algorithms such as neural networks was no small feat. It took a year of unwavering dedication and countless hours of study to truly understand the core of these concepts. Andrew Ng's courses were instrumental in this growth, providing clarity and depth. My academic pursuits did not end there; I’ve been consistently enrolling in courses to enhance not only my data science expertise but also my software engineering skills.

          The horizon of my future in this domain looks promising. I am thrilled by the prospect of drafting research papers under the esteemed guidance of professors at Case Western Reserve University. Currently, my compass points towards computer vision in the medical field—a direction influenced by my proximity to the renowned Cleveland Clinic. Being a mere five-minute walk away from this institution fuels my aspirations of collaborative research and potentially groundbreaking work in the realm of medical technology.
